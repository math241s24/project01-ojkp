## Introducing the Data {.smaller}

###### From the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency): conc. levels of major pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM 2.5, and SO2)

-   Focusing on the Portland-Hillsboro-Vancouver area from 2017-2023.

-   Subsets into two forms for each pollutant type:

    -   84 x 2 monthly average air pollutant

    -   28606 x 4 daily air pollutant data.

-   10 datasets (5 of each type). Below is a glimpse into one of our datasets; this records the average concentration of each pollutant monthly for the years 2017-2023.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(reshape2)
library(viridis)
avgAll <- read_csv("data/air_pollutants/avgAll.csv")
glimpse(avgAll)

```

## Question 1

###### How did the COVID pandemic lockdown impact air quality in the Portland Metropolitan area? {.smaller}

-   Relevant question that experts are asking right now

-   Looked at a timespan of 7 years to get a sense of AQI before/during/after lockdown

    -   Highlighted 2020-2021 as prime lockdown years

    -   Used our monthly average subsets to see a change over time

-   Cars emit CO and NO2; paid special attention to these compounds

## Question 1 Contd

## Question 1: Discussion

-   General trend: PM2.5 increases in winter, decreases in summer

-   Warm air rises, along with the particles

    -   Exception: 2020 late summer (stay tuned for explanation!)

-   Overall, somewhat decrease during COVID years, would need additional analysis to confirm trends



## Question 2

###### Is there a relationship between wildfire season and air pollutant concentrations? {.smaller}

-   Interested in potential environmental impacts (GHG levels) and adverse health effects

-   Looked at a timespan of 7 years to get a sense of AQI before/during/after lockdown

    -   Highlighted May-September as potential hazard months

    -   Plotted daily values to see seasonal variations

-   Paid special attention to PM2.5, NO2, and O3 (ozone)
