Below is a glimpse into one of our datasets; this records the average concentration of each pollutant monthly for the years 2017-2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 84\nColumns: 9\n$ month       <dbl> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,…\n$ year        <chr> \"2017\", \"2017\", \"2017\", \"2017\", \"2017\", \"2017\", \"2017\", \"2…\n$ monthbyyear <dbl> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7…\n$ month_year  <chr> \"2017-01\", \"2017-02\", \"2017-03\", \"2017-04\", \"2017-05\", \"20…\n$ avg_pm2.5   <dbl> 9.776526, 5.328638, 3.842800, 3.857500, 3.912355, 3.677011…\n$ avg_so2     <dbl> 0.8208333, 0.5615385, 0.5750000, 0.5400000, 0.6100000, 0.4…\n$ avg_ozone   <dbl> 0.02901818, 0.03053333, 0.03338462, 0.03662712, 0.03674011…\n$ avg_no2     <dbl> 21.90484, 23.49273, 21.63103, 21.97778, 18.15574, 14.34667…\n$ avg_co      <dbl> 0.4800000, 0.3854545, 0.3516129, 0.3416667, NA, 0.2500000,…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 1\n\n###### How did the COVID pandemic lockdown impact air quality in the Portland Metropolitan area? {.smaller}\n\n-   Relevant question that experts are asking right now\n\n-   Looked at a timespan of 7 years to get a sense of AQI before/during/after lockdown\n\n    -   Highlighted 2020-2021 as prime lockdown years\n\n    -   Used our monthly average subsets to see a change over time\n\n-   Cars emit CO and NO2; paid special attention to these compounds\n\n## Question 1: PM2.5 \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/PM2.5 graph-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Question 1: Pollutants in 2019\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/2019 concentration trends graph-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 1: Pollutants in 2020\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/2020 concentration trends-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 1: Discussion\n\n-   General trend: PM2.5 increases in winter, decreases in summer for all years\n\n-   Warm air rises, along with the particles\n\n    -   Exception: 2020 late summer (stay tuned for explanation!)\n\n-   SO2 went down in 2020 compared to 2019 (main source: electric utilities, businesses closing?)\n\n    -   Other pollutants don't have as much of noticeable difference\n\n-   Overall, somewhat decrease during COVID years, would need additional analysis to confirm trends\n\n## Question 2\n\n###### Is there a relationship between wildfire season and air pollutant concentrations? {.smaller}\n\n-   Interested in potential environmental impacts (GHG levels) and adverse health effects\n\n-   Looked at a timespan of 7 years to get a sense of AQI before/during/after lockdown\n\n    -   Highlighted May-September as potential hazard months\n\n    -   Plotted daily values to see seasonal variations\n\n-   Paid special attention to PM2.5, CO, and O3 (ozone)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Question 2: CO from 2017-2023\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/wildfire graph-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 2: Pollutants in 2017-2023\n\n![](Prerendered Pictures/wildfireAll.svg)\n\n\n\n\n## Question 2: Pollutants in 2019\n\n![](Prerendered Pictures/wildfire2019.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Question 2: Pollutants in 2020\n\n![](Prerendered Pictures/wildfire2020.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Question 2: Discussion\n\n-   2020 had huge wildfire: biggest impact on AQI, PM, and CO\n\n-   Not all seasonal trends due to fire season\n\n    -   NO2 decreases with solar radiation\n\n    -   Ozone increases with NO2 reaction in the summer\n\n-   Disaster had noticeable impact, regular fire season not so much beyond expected seasonal fluctuations\n\n-   Changes may be more drastic as fires get worse and climate changes\n\n# Thank you!\n",
