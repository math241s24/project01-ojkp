    "text": "Proposal\nYour proposal should include:\n\nA brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)\nThe reason why you chose this dataset.\nThe two questions you want to answer.\n\nA plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n\n\nWe are using air quality data from the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). Their data records atmospheric concentrations of major pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM 2.5, and SO2) every day of the year in geographic areas across the United States. The data can be as granular as county level; for our research purposes, we are focusing on the Portland metropolitan area (Portland-Hillsboro-Vancouver) and using data from 2017-2023. For our two research questions, we have subsetted the EPA data into two forms for each pollutant type: a 84 x 2 monthly average air pollutant and a 28606 x 4 daily air pollutant data. The specific number of observations differs by data set, due to the dataset having information from multiple sites in the Portland area. We have 10 datasets (5 of each type). Below is a glimpse into how our two forms of datasets are structured for one of our chosen top pollutants (PM2.5) which is 2 out of our 10 datasets.\n\nDaily data about PM2.5 mean concentration from each site in Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro from 2017 to 2023:\n\n\nRows: 28,606\nColumns: 4\n$ Date                             &lt;date&gt; 2017-06-16, 2017-06-17, 2017-06-18, …\n$ `Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration` &lt;dbl&gt; 2.3, 3.7, 3.0, 5.4, 2.9, 3.9, 3.6, 3.…\n$ DAILY_AQI_VALUE                  &lt;dbl&gt; 10, 15, 13, 23, 12, 16, 15, 16, 15, 1…\n$ CBSA_NAME                        &lt;chr&gt; \"Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA\"…\n\n\nMonthly averages of PM2.5 daily mean concentrations in Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro from 2017 to 2023:\n\n\nRows: 84\nColumns: 2\n$ month_year &lt;chr&gt; \"2017-01\", \"2017-02\", \"2017-03\", \"2017-04\", \"2017-05\", \"201…\n$ avg_pm2.5  &lt;dbl&gt; 9.776526, 5.328638, 3.842800, 3.857500, 3.912355, 3.677011,…\n\n\n\nWe wanted to explore environmental data because it can be considered a “subversive” topic by some audiences. We believe it is important to study environmental trends in order to confirm or deny common arguments and observe relationships between anthropogenic activity and environmental impacts. We chose this dataset because it is accessible through the EPA’s website and can be easily filtered from the AQI monitoring webpage by type of pollutant, geographic area, and year.\nOur two questions are:\n\n\nHow did the COVID pandemic lockdown impact air quality in the Portland Metropolitan area?\nIs there a correlation between wildfire season and air quality fluctuations in the Portland Metropolitan area?\n\n\nFor our first question, we will be visualizing changes over time for the 5 major pollutants above in the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro area. We will be using data from 2017 to 2023 in order to get a sense of what the air quality looked like before the pandemic, during the pandemic (highlighting 2020-2021 as prime lockdown years), and seeing if pollutant concentrations increased after lockdown restrictions were lifted (from 2022-2023). We will plot monthly averages for each pollutant and graph the changes across the 7 year time span on a line graph, with multiple lines for each pollutant. If there are too many observations we may split the data into three graphs (before, during, and after lockdown).\n\nFor our second question, we will plot observations for the first, 15th, and last day of each month across one year. We will observe whether there is a stark increase in pollutant concentrations during the wildfire season (July-September) and have multiple lines to see which pollutants in particular increase. We will make a graph for each year to check for precision."

The intensity of these fires is of concern to public safety both immediately in fire prone areas as well as for communities facing decreased air quality from smoke. We are interested in exploring this aspect of the issue of wildfires by analyzing concentration levels of major pollutants produced by wildfires (particularly PM2.5, NO2, Ozone and general AQI) before during and after fire season. \n\n#Approach:\n#Our assumption is that during wildfire season, more pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere, meaning that from mid-May to September pollutant concentrations will go up. We used six years from our pollutant dataset which offers pollutant concentration by day as well as in a more succinct format with the first, 15th, and last day of the month. We also pulled in our fire dataset which offers the total protected acres burned by day across the six years in order to differentiate between general seasonal fluctuations and the actual severity of wildfire season across years.\n#Julian's graph\n#In our first graph, we focused on the concentration of carbon monoxide across years since this is one of the most prominent pollutants associated with wildfires. This data was visualized by a column graph where each column is a month, sectioned by color and year, with markers indicating the standard wildfire seasons.\n\n# Our second graph considers other pollutant levels over each year from 2017-2023 in order to consider overall trends in pollutant concentration fluctuation. It is presented alongside wildfire data in order to consider to what extent the fluctuation is impacted by wildfire season. This is done with a series of line graphs. These plots help to better visualize the relationship between wildfires and air pollution which aligns with our primary goal.\n\n\n#graphing fires\n#considering changing severity of fire seasons over years\nggplot(data = fires_full, aes(x=ReportDate, y = tot_ProAcres)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\nfires_full &lt;- fires_full %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = year(ReportDate))\n\nggplot(data = fires_full, aes(x=ReportDate, y = tot_ProAcres)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~year, scales = \"free_x\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size=5))\n\n\n\n\n\n# In the proposal we said we'd plot observations for the first, 15th, and last day of each month across one year, and observe whether there is a stark increase in pollutant concentrations during the wildfire season (July-September) and have multiple lines to see which pollutants in particular increase. \n#instead of separate lines, separate graphs for unit/interpretating reasons\n#but yeah this is that from the proposal\n\n#data for first 15th and last day of month\npollutants_FML &lt;- pollutants_pdx_melt %&gt;%\n  mutate(day = day(Date)) %&gt;%\n  filter(day == 1 | day == 15 | day == max(day)) %&gt;%\n  select(-day)  \n\n#2017, considering trends in just one year, can be altered for whichever year\nggplot(pollutants_FML %&gt;% \n         filter(year == 2017), aes(x = Date, y = avrg_reading, color = variable)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable + year, scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(title = \"Observations for First, 15th, and Last Day of Each Month\",\n       x = \"Date\", \n       y = \"Reading\") +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size=5))\n\n\n\n#on one super mega huge giant ggplot to see how this holds up across years\nggplot(pollutants_FML, aes(x = Date, y = avrg_reading, color = variable)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable + year, scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(title = \"Observations for First, 15th, and Last Day of Each Month\",\n       x = \"Date\", y = \"Reading\") +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size=5))\n\n\n\n\n\n#this could be graph 2\n#uhhhh this is a visualization with all the pollutants over all the years compared to wildfires\n#Its a little yucky but shows a seasonal pattern of fluctuation in pollutant levels thats pretty clear (esp for NO2 and Ozone).

    "text": "This project is developed by Kiana Fields, Julian Jacklin, Prasiddhi Thapaliya, and Omar Youssif as a template for the first mini-project of Math/Stat 241 at Reed College. In this project, we’re examining air pollution and environmental factors through analyzing Portland Metropolitian Area’s air quality and pollution.\nIn this project, we guided it through two questions. First, how did the COVID pandemic lockdown impact air quality in the Portland Metropolitan area? The other question was whether there was a relationship between wildfire season and air pollutant concentrations?\nWe used R for our analysis and attained our data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We also used Quarto for our website and presentation, and GitHub to store our files in a repository."

    "text": "We are using data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Their tool provides daily records of air pollutant concentrations of various atmospheric pollutants. This can be filtered by geographic area such as state, city, county, or specific monitoring site. The typical units for each pollutant, depending on its abundance in the air, is either in ppm (parts per million), ppb (parts per billion), or µg/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter).\nFor our research, we narrowed our focus on the Portland-Hillsboro-Vancouver area to analyze changes in pollutant concentration and thus air quality. We looked at the following atmospheric compounds: CO (carbon monoxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), O3 (ozone), PM2.5 (fine particulate matter), and SO2 (sulfur dioxide). We chose these because they are the most abundant and seem to be the most talked about greenhouse gases among the general population.\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 and it’s effects have impacted us all. As with any pandemic, the primary concerns worldwide were largely related to public health and economic welfare. Like many other nations, the U.S met the the concerns of the former, by enacting state-by-state quarantines (“stay-at-home” orders). Subsequently, major metropolitan centers in the nation characterized by greater motor-vehicle traffic, experienced a dramatic dip in commuter density as quarantine mandates went into effect and drastically fewer commuters had to drive to work each day. One impact of COVID-19 that has yet to be discussed as severely as the others, is its impact on our climate; particularly, on air quality. A popular assumption, is that air quality improved during this time, as less commuters were “on the road”, and so less vehicles were used and emitting pollutants. We are interested in exploring this assumption by analyzing the concentration levels of major pollutants produced by motor-vehicles (namely, the variables PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and Ozone), before, during, and after quarantine, using our chosen dataset.\n\n\n\nOur underlying hypothesis is that fewer pollutants were emitted into the atmosphere in Portland from March 2020 - June 2021 (span of Oregon state quarantine mandate). Our dataset offers average pollutant concentrations by month, over several years (Jan 2017 - Dec 2023). In our first graph we have chosen to focus on PM2.5 concentrations over this 7-year window, since this is the most hazardous and prominent pollutant that motor-vehicles emit. Additionally, we’d like to observe its trends in recent history, through the quarantine, and afterward, to identify any contrasts. We are visualizing this data by a column graph such that each column is a month, sectioned by color and year, with markers indicating the beginning and end of Oregon’s quarantine. Our second graph (a collection of three plots) explores concentration trends by the other pollutants, over each year in the immediate window around quarantine (2019, 2020, 2021). This is done via a trend line, overlayed by columns to distinguish monthly concentrations readings. Both of these plots help us better visualize trends in major pollutant concentrations over time.\n\n\n\nIn this section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides. You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not required to do so. All plots must be made with ggplot2. Do not use base R or lattice plotting functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our graphs, we can see some general trends that apply to all years. For example, PM2.5 concentrations tend to increase in the winter and decrease in the summer throughout the time series, indicating normal seasnal fluctuations. We found out that this is because as the air gets warmer, it rises and brings fine particulate matter higher into the atmosphere. An exception to this is in September 2020, a phenomenon which will be explained in our second analysis.\nDuring 2020, SO2 concentration levels seemed to have a more dramatic decrease compared to 2019, a year which we consider to be a “normal” observation for comparison. In March 2020, SO2 seems to have gone down significantly compared to in 2019 where there is a gradual decrease throughout the first half of the year. One main source of SO2 is emisisons from electric utilities, suggesting a potential correlation between COVID lockdown and SO2 emissions. This may be due to businesses and other buildings closing with the quarantine policy in place.\nOverall, other pollutants do not seem to have been majorly impacted by the COVID lockdown. CO and PM2.5 are the only ones that had significant changes in September. In order to confirm any effect of the quarantine on air quality, further analysis would be needed. A potential avenue for further research is looking at how specifically motor vehicle activity changed over the pandemic, perhaps by isolating those pollutants through further scientific approaches.\n\n\n\n\nThe intensity of Oregon’s wildfire season in Oregon has increased over time as a result of historical forest management as well as climate change effects. The intensity of these fires is of concern to public safety both immediately in fire prone areas as well as for communities facing decreased air quality from smoke. We are interested in exploring this aspect of the issue of wildfires by analyzing concentration levels of major pollutants produced by wildfires (particularly PM2.5, NO2, Ozone and general AQI) before during and after fire season.\n\n\nOur assumption is that during wildfire season, more pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere, meaning that from mid-May to September pollutant concentrations will go up. We used six years from our pollutant dataset which offers pollutant concentration by day as well as in a more succinct format with the first, 15th, and last day of the month. We also pulled in our fire dataset which offers the total protected acres burned by day across the six years in order to differentiate between general seasonal fluctuations and the actual severity of wildfire season across years.\nIn our first graph from question 1, we focused on the concentration of carbon monoxide across years since this is one of the most prominent pollutants associated with wildfires. This data was visualized by a column graph where each column is a month, sectioned by color and year, with markers indicating the standard wildfire seasons.\nOur second graph considers other pollutant levels over each year from 2017-2023 in order to consider overall trends in pollutant concentration fluctuation. It is presented alongside wildfire data in order to consider to what extent the fluctuation is impacted by wildfire season. This is done with a series of line graphs. These plots help to better visualize the relationship between wildfires and air pollution which aligns with our primary goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFrom our graphs, we notice that there are typical seasonal fluctuations for various pollutants; not all of these trends are due to wildfire season. We found out that NO2 decreases in the presence of solar radiation and reacts to form Ozone, which explains the respective decrease and increase for those pollutants in the summer.\n2020 had a huge wildfire, the Archie Creek Fire, in late September in Oregon. This disaster had a noticeable impact on air quality. During this month, PM2.5, CO, and AQI (Air Quality Index) all skyrocketed. Other pollutants did not undergo much of a change. From this analysis, we can see that normal fire seasons don’t necessarily have huge impacts on pollutant levels, but a disaster on the scale of the Archie Creek fire can have drastic effects. As cliamte change worsens, temperatures increase, and the summers get drier, we may see regular fire seasons getting worse over time."
