-   about.qmd: This has a general project description page. You can open the website by rendering this file.

-   index.qmd: This includes our write-up where we talk about the justification of our approaches, while summarizing our findings and conclusions.

-   presentation.qmd: This is the quarto file that includes all of our presentation slides and some of the data used to process them.

-   proposal.qmd: This is the file where we did our project proposal and have some data processing in it.

Under a folder named data is where all of our data is stored (split across proposal data and air pollutant data). The data is stored as csv's.

Under the folder "code", we have these following files:

-   DataCleanup.Rmd: This is where we have all our major data wrangling to process raw EPA data into tidy data to work with.

-   Question1.Rmd: This is where the visualizations have been explored for Question 1.

-   Question2.Rmd: This is where the visualizations have been explored for Question 2.

-   VisualizationsLab.Rmd: This is where a lot of exploratory data analysis & visualizations were done, so we can more formally analyze it.
